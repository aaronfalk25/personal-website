                I view the field of software development as the most artistic form of problem-solving in modern engineering.
                The crux of computer science is taking on a new problem and delivering a solution that is elegant, precise, and carefully crafted.
                Ever since I started coding in middle school, I have been deepening my understanding of how to leverage modern technologies and skills to interface with the technical world around us.

                As I am studying my coursework at Penn State, I am learning how to take the rigor of computer science and marry it with my imagination and creativity. 
                My goal is to continually transform my understanding and abilities by taking on new projects and never being afraid to ask questions. 
                I hope to inspire others and progress my view of technology.
                </p>

                I am currently seeking opportunities to grow my skills and knowledge in software development. Whether that is a full-time position, internship, or a project collaboration, I am always open to new opportunities.
                As I am looking ahead to my graduation in December, I am excited to see where my journey in software development will take me.
                </p>

                Outside of professional work, I am an avid believer in community and valued friendships.
                Whether it's playing volleyball, hiking, or just hanging out with friends, I am always looking for ways to connect with others.
                At Penn State, I've had the great joy of knowing a deep and rich community, and I have learned what it means to be truly valued.
                Looking ahead again, I am excited to see where my journey in software development will take me and the people I will meet along the way.
